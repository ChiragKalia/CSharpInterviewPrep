> Hi All, In this repo I will add some links that will be my study topics to  prepare for .NET C# interviews in one month.

This is meant for guys who feel like stagnated at their current job or they don't have much exposure or feel like their current job is not challenging anymore. I am also one of these guys and I feel like I'm stagnated currently. I aspire to join one of the big 4's one day.

## Why use it?

If you are planning to appear for interviews and you feel like you're out of sync with the latest changes to the .NET Framework,
Then it's the right place for you. In this repo, I'll add study material links starting from scratch that'll help you in your journey. 

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.
