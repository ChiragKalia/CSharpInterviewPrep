# CSharp Interview Preparation
> Hi All, In this repo I will add some links that will be my study topics to  prepare for .NET C# interviews in one week.

*Inspired from JWasham's coding-interview-university*
## What is it?

This is my week long(maybe more) study plan to get myself a decent job at a big companies(MNC's)

This is meant for guys who feel like stagnated at their current job or they don't have much exposure or feel like their current job is not challenging anymore. I am also one of these guys and I feel like I'm stagnated currently. I aspire to join one of the big 4's one day.

## Why use it?

If you are planning to appear for interviews and you feel like you're out of sync with the latest changes to the .NET Framework,
Then it's the right place for you. In this repo, I'll add study material links starting from scratch that'll help you in your journey. 

It's not a long plan. It's just a list of interview relevant links that are useful during interviews. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- [ ] **Learn C#**
    - C# is everywhere in .NET Land. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying .NET.
    - [ ] [CLR With C#](http://www.amazon.in/CLR-via-C-Microsoft-Press/dp/9351190900/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1491503871&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=clr+via+csharp)
        - This is a nice book, It will give you a great handle on how CLR works and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C# helps you understand how programs and memory work.
- [ ] **Learn C# MVC**
    - I have added C# MVC to the list of pre requisites because a lot of interviews demand user to know about C# MVC (If you don't know 		it then it's not a big issue unless the job you're applying to says so)

- [ ] **Learn C# WCF(Not Mandatory)**
	- [ ] [WCF Tutorials(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmfPmqMk9Xs&list=PL6n9fhu94yhVxEyaRMaMN_-qnDdNVGsL1)
		- These tutorials were the best I could find online. These videos provide a hands on experience creating WCF services.
		You can learn WCF step by step by following these video lectures.
    - C# WCF's knowledge is not mandatory as a lot of people don't know about WCF. It's an added bonus if you want to prepare it too.
